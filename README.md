# Simple Quiz App in Flutter

This is a simple quiz app built using the Flutter framework. The app consists of three screens: a start screen to begin the quiz, a questions screen to display and answer questions one by one, and a result screen to show the summary of questions answered and the number of correct answers. Additionally, there is a restart button on the result screen to restart the quiz from the beginning.

## Screens

### Start Screen

The start screen is the initial screen of the app. It provides a "Start Quiz" button that the user can tap to begin the quiz.

### Questions Screen
The questions screen is where the quiz questions are displayed one by one. The user can select an answer and proceed to the next question. There is a progress indicator to show the current question number out of the total number of questions.

### Result Screen
The result screen is displayed after the user completes all the questions. It shows a summary of the user's performance, including the number of questions answered correctly and the total number of questions. A "Restart Quiz" button is provided to start the quiz again from the first question.
